### Form Integration

The contact form currently shows a success modal after 2 seconds. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Replace the setTimeout in `script.js` with an actual API call
2. Add proper error handling for failed submissions
3. Consider adding CSRF protection and rate limiting
4. The success modal provides better UX than inline messages
